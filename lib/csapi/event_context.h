     * \param eventId
     *   The event to get context around.
     *
     * \param limit
     *   The maximum number of context events to return. The limit applies
     *   to the sum of the `events_before` and `events_after` arrays. The
     *   requested event ID is always returned in `event` even if `limit` is
     *   0. Defaults to 10.
     *
     * \param filter
     *   A JSON `RoomEventFilter` to filter the returned events with. The
     *   filter is only applied to `events_before`, `events_after`, and
     *   `state`. It is not applied to the `event` itself. The filter may
     *   be applied before or/and after the `limit` parameter - whichever the
     *   homeserver prefers.
     *
     *   See [Filtering](/client-server-api/#filtering) for more information.
