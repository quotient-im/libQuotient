/*! \brief Knock on a room, requesting permission to join.
 *
 * *Note that this API takes either a room ID or alias, unlike other membership
 * APIs.*
 *
 * This API "knocks" on the room to ask for permission to join, if the user
 * is allowed to knock on the room. Acceptance of the knock happens out of
 * band from this API, meaning that the client will have to watch for updates
 * regarding the acceptance/rejection of the knock.
 *
 * If the room history settings allow, the user will still be able to see
 * history of the room while being in the "knock" state. The user will have
 * to accept the invitation to join the room (acceptance of knock) to see
 * messages reliably. See the `/join` endpoints for more information about
 * history visibility to the user.
 *
 * The knock will appear as an entry in the response of the
 * [`/sync`](/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv3sync) API.
