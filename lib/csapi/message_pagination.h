 * pagination query parameters to paginate history in the room.

 * [Lazy-loading room members](/client-server-api/#lazy-loading-room-members)

    /*! \brief Get a list of events for this room
     *
     * \param roomId
     *   The room to get events from.
     *
     * \param dir
     *   The direction to return events from. If this is set to `f`, events
     *   will be returned in chronological order starting at `from`. If it
     *   is set to `b`, events will be returned in *reverse* chronological
     *   order, again starting at `from`.
     *
     * \param from
     *   The token to start returning events from. This token can be obtained
     *   from a `prev_batch` or `next_batch` token returned by the `/sync`
     * endpoint, or from an `end` token returned by a previous request to this
     * endpoint.
     *
     *   This endpoint can also accept a value returned as a `start` token
     *   by a previous request to this endpoint, though servers are not
     *   required to support this. Clients should not rely on the behaviour.
     *
     *   If it is not provided, the homeserver shall return a list of messages
     *   from the first or last (per the value of the `dir` parameter) visible
     *   event in the room history for the requesting user.
     *
     * \param to
     *   The token to stop returning events at. This token can be obtained from
     *   a `prev_batch` or `next_batch` token returned by the `/sync` endpoint,
     *   or from an `end` token returned by a previous request to this endpoint.
     *
     * \param limit
     *   The maximum number of events to return. Default: 10.
     *
     * \param filter
     *   A JSON RoomEventFilter to filter returned events with.
