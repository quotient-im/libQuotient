/*! \brief Invite a user to participate in a particular room.
 *
 * *Note that there are two forms of this API, which are documented separately.
 * This version of the API does not require that the inviter know the Matrix
 * identifier of the invitee, and instead relies on third party identifiers.
 * The homeserver uses an identity server to perform the mapping from
 * third party identifier to a Matrix identifier. The other is documented in
 * the* [joining rooms
 * section](/client-server-api/#post_matrixclientv3roomsroomidinvite).
 *
 * This API invites a user to participate in a particular room.
 * They do not start participating in the room until they actually join the
 * room.
 *
 * Only users currently in a particular room can invite other users to
 * join that room.
 *
 * If the identity server did know the Matrix user identifier for the
 * third party identifier, the homeserver will append a `m.room.member`
 * event to the room.
 *
 * If the identity server does not know a Matrix user identifier for the
 * passed third party identifier, the homeserver will issue an invitation
 * which can be accepted upon providing proof of ownership of the third
 * party identifier. This is achieved by the identity server generating a
 * token, which it gives to the inviting homeserver. The homeserver will
 * add an `m.room.third_party_invite` event into the graph for the room,
 * containing that token.
 *
 * When the invitee binds the invited third party identifier to a Matrix
 * user ID, the identity server will give the user a list of pending
 * invitations, each containing:
 *
 * - The room ID to which they were invited
 *
 * - The token given to the homeserver
 *
 * - A signature of the token, signed with the identity server's private key
 *
 * - The matrix user ID who invited them to the room
 *
 * If a token is requested from the identity server, the homeserver will
 * append a `m.room.third_party_invite` event to the room.
