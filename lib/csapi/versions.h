 * Gets the versions of the specification supported by the server.
 *
 * Values will take the form `vX.Y` or `rX.Y.Z` in historical cases. See
 * [the Specification Versioning](../#specification-versions) for more
 * information.
 *
 * The server may additionally advertise experimental features it supports
 * through `unstable_features`. These features should be namespaced and
 * may optionally include version information within their name if desired.
 * Features listed here are not for optionally toggling parts of the Matrix
 * specification and should only be used to advertise support for a feature
 * which has not yet landed in the spec. For example, a feature currently
 * undergoing the proposal process may appear here and eventually be taken
 * off this list once the feature lands in the spec and the server deems it
 * reasonable to do so. Servers may wish to keep advertising features here
 * after they've been released into the spec to give clients a chance to
 * upgrade appropriately. Additionally, clients should avoid using unstable
 * features in their stable releases.
